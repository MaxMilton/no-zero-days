# ðŸ’ª React.js No Zero Days Web App

A **React.js powered personal productivity system** to help you achieve something every single day and build a habit of daily self improvement.

Live demo: <https://nozerodays.maxmilton.com> _(coming soon)_.

## Technical overview

This project is a fun way for me to make something substantial using a React based tech stack. Built using:

* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) JavaScript framework
* [Blueprint](http://blueprintjs.com/) UI framework
* [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) API + [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) GraphQL server/client
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) NoSQL database
* [Jest](http://jestjs.io) test framework
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io) JavaScript transpiler + [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) asset bundler
* Microservice architecture using [Docker](https://www.docker.com) containers

## How it works

Get out of the rut of feeling like you didn't achieve anything valuable today.

Decide on small tasks you want to achieve daily and how how many points they're worth. Make a commitment to complete tasks every day to a minimum score. It doesn't matter if the tasks are small but they should move you forward towards your personal goals. Lots of little steps each day will add up to big changes over time.
