# React Personal Productivity System

A personal productivity system to help you achieve the small things every day.

Get out of the rut of feeling like you didn't achieve anything valuable today.

## Technical overview

* React.js
* Redux
* GraphQL + Apollo + Express.js
* MongoDB

* Jest

* Microservice architecture
* Docker

## How it works

Decide on small tasks you want to achieve daily and how how many points they're worth. Make a commitment to complete tasks every day to a minimum score. It doesn't matter if the tasks are small but they should move you forward towards your personal goals. Lots of little steps each day will add up to big changes over time.
